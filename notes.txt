Project Related Notes (Riley)
-----------------------------

Heroku
------
Our app configuration is setup via the webapp, which means we do not need to configure anything in our GitHub workflows
for Heroku-specific deployments, and also means that using the Heroku CLI is not necessary (so far).

GitHub Actions
--------------
Currently configured for Python 3.12.
First runs tests via GitHub actions, if tests pass it will send to Heroku. It can still fail once in Heroku for other reasons.

Django
------
Allowed hosts must have our Heroku URL in order to avoid a DisallowedHosts error, optionally we may be able to change the URL
and also add ".herokuapp.com" to allow any arbitrary Heroku domain for hosting the project.

PostgreSQL
----------
Database setup has not begun yet.

Whitenoise
----------
Django does not support static asset serving, to fix this we have Whitenoise enabled (hence why we have it in middleware).
I don't fully understand this yet, but these links provide good additional info if one is curious.
